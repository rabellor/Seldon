    "Mike is a stock trader and makes a profit by buying and selling stocks. He buys a stock at a lower price and sells it at a higher price to book a profit. He has come to know the stock prices of a particular stock for  upcoming days in future and wants to calculate the maximum profit by doing the right transactions (single transaction = buying + selling). Can you help him maximize his profit?\n",

    "Given the stock prices and a positive integer , find and print the maximum profit Mike can make in at most transactions.\n",
